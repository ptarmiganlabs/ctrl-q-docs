## Certificates

If the `--auth-type` option is set to `cert`, Ctrl-Q will authenticate with Qlik Sense Enterprise using certificates.  
This is the default authentication method that will be used if no `--auth-type` option is specified.

These certificates are [exported from the QMC](https://help.qlik.com/en-US/sense-admin/May2023/Subsystems/DeployAdministerQSE/Content/Sense_DeployAdminister/QSEoW/Administer_QSEoW/Managing_QSEoW/export-certificates.htm) and stored on disk in PEM format.

Three certificate files are needed (and exported from the QMC):

1. The client certificate, which is used to authenticate with the Sense engine.
2. The client key, which is used to authenticate with the Sense engine.
3. The root certificate, which is needed to verify the Sense server's certificate (as Qlik Sense uses a self-signed certificate).

Ctrl-Q can reference these certificates in two ways:

1. if one or more of the `--auth-cert-file`, `auth-cert-key-file` and `--auth-root-cert-file` options are used, Ctrl-Q will read the certificates from the disk file(s) pointed to by those options.
2. If one or more of the options above are _not_ specified when Ctrl-Q is started, it will look for certificates in the `config` folder in the same folder as the Ctrl-Q executable. 
   1. The certificate files must then be named `client.pem`, `client_key.pem` and `root.pem`, i.e. the names used by the QMC when exporting the certificates.

If the `-secure false` option is used, Ctrl-Q will not verify the Sense server's certificate.  
This is not recommended from a security perspective, but can still be useful if you are having trouble getting Ctrl-Q to authenticate with Sense.

The options `--auth-user-dir` and `-auth-user-id` are also needed to authenticate with Sense.  
They define which user will be used when interacting with both the engine and repository APIs.

### Strict or relaxed certificate validation

When using certificate authentication, Ctrl-Q will by default validate the Sense server's certificate.  
This happens as the default value for the `--secure` option is `true`.

What does "validate the certificate" mean?

Validating a certificate means that Ctrl-Q will check that the certificate is signed by a trusted authority, that it has not expired, and that the server's hostname matches the certificate's common name.

For example, if the certificate is created for a host called `pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net`, Ctrl-Q will - by verifying the server certificate - check that the server it is connecting to is indeed `pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net`.  
If the server's hostname does not match the certificate's common name, Ctrl-Q will refuse to connect.  
Looks like this:

```bash
PS C:\tools\ctrl-q> .\ctrl-q.exe connection-test `
>> --host pro2-win1.ptarmiganlabs.net `
>> --auth-user-dir LAB `
>> --auth-user-id goran

```

Ctrl-Q tells us that something is not right with the certificate and we even get a pretty clear message about what is wrong.

Changing the command to use the correct hostname makes the error go away and the command works as expected:

```bash
PS C:\tools\ctrl-q> .\ctrl-q.exe connection-test `
>> --host pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net `
>> --auth-user-dir LAB `
>> --auth-user-id goran

```

All this said, if you are having trouble getting Ctrl-Q to connect to Sense, you can use the `--secure false` option to disable certificate validation.
Not preferred from a security perspective, but it can still be useful if you are having trouble getting Ctrl-Q to authenticate with Sense.

### Ports used for certificate authentication

When using certificate authentication, Ctrl-Q will connect to the Qlik Engine API on port 4747.

When using certificate authentication, Ctrl-Q will connect directly to the various Qlik Sense services on the port exposed by each service:

- Qlik Repository Service (QRS) on port 4242
- Qlik Proxy Service (QPS) on port 4243
- Qlik Engine Service (QES) on port 4747

If the default ports are not used, each Ctrl-Q command allows you to specify the port to use for each Sense service.

## JWTs

If the `--auth-type` option is set to `jwt`, Ctrl-Q will authenticate with Qlik Sense Enterprise using JWTs.

JWTs - JSON Web Tokens - are a standard way of authenticating with web services, where a token is issued by an authentication service and then used to authenticate with other services.  
JWTs contain a number of claims, including the user ID, which is used to identify the user.

{{% alert title="ðŸ’¡ Remember" color="primary" %}}
JWTs are essentially full credentials in a single file.  
I.e. anyone with a JWT can authenticate with Sense as the user that the JWT was issued for.

Treat JWTs as you would any other credentials (e.g. passwords etc).
{{% /alert %}}

When Ctrl-Q is started with `--auth-type` option set to `jwt`, it will then look for an option called `--auth-jwt`.  
Pass in the JWT as the value of this option, and Ctrl-Q will use it to authenticate with Sense.  
Embed the JWT in double quotes if it contains special characters (e.g. spaces).

### Ports used for JWT authentication

Given the nature of JWT authentication and the fact that it is handled on a virtual proxy level, Ctrl-Q cannot connect directly to the Qlik Sense services when using JWT authentication.  
Instead all access must go via a virtual proxy that is configured to use JWT authentication.

This in turn means that Ctrl-Q will need to use whatever port the virtual proxy is configured to use.  
Usually this is port 443, but it can be any port, as configured in the proxy linked to the virtual proxy.  

**Remember to specify the correct port when using JWT authentication, using the `--port` (might be called `--proxy-port` or similar in some Ctrl-Q commands) option.**

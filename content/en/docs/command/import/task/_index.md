All example below use Windows Terminal/PowerShell.

## Import tasks from file

Task definitions can be read from CSV or Excel files.  
The options are as follows:

```powershell
.\ctrl-q.exe task-import --help
```

```text
Usage: ctrl-q task-import [options]

create tasks based on definitions in a file on disk, optionally also importing apps from QVF files.

Options:
  --log-level <level>                log level (choices: "error", "warn", "info", "verbose", "debug", "silly", default: "info")
  --host <host>                      Qlik Sense server IP/FQDN
  --port <port>                      Qlik Sense repository service (QRS) port (usually 4242 for cert auth, 443 for jwt auth) (default: "4242")
  --schema-version <string>          Qlik Sense engine schema version (default: "12.612.0")
  --virtual-proxy <prefix>           Qlik Sense virtual proxy prefix (default: "")
  --secure <true|false>              https connection to Qlik Sense must use correct certificate. Invalid certificates will result in rejected/failed connection. (default: true)
  --auth-user-dir <directory>        user directory for user to connect with
  --auth-user-id <userid>            user ID for user to connect with
  -a, --auth-type <type>             authentication type (choices: "cert", "jwt", default: "cert")
  --auth-cert-file <file>            Qlik Sense certificate file (exported from QMC) (default: "./cert/client.pem")
  --auth-cert-key-file <file>        Qlik Sense certificate key file (exported from QMC) (default: "./cert/client_key.pem")
  --auth-root-cert-file <file>       Qlik Sense root certificate file (exported from QMC) (default: "./cert/root.pem")
  --auth-jwt <jwt>                   JSON Web Token (JWT) to use for authentication with Qlik Sense server
  -t, --file-type <type>             source file type (choices: "excel", "csv", default: "excel")
  --file-name <filename>             file containing task definitions
  --sheet-name <name>                name of Excel sheet where task info is found
  --update-mode <mode>               create new or update existing tasks (choices: "create", default: "create")
  --limit-import-count <number>      import at most x number of tasks from the source file. Defaults to 0 = no limit (default: 0)
  --sleep-app-upload <milliseconds>  Wait this long before continuing after each app has been uploaded to Sense. Defaults to 1000 = 1 second (default: 1000)
  --import-app                       import Sense app QVFs from specified directory
  --import-app-sheet-name <name>     name of Excel sheet where app definitions are found
  --dry-run                          do a dry run, i.e. do not create any reload tasks - just show what would be done
  -h, --help                         display help for command
```

The options are *almost* the same irrespective of source file type:

The `--sheet-name` is only used/valid/relevant when `--file-type` is set to `excel`.  
Why? Because there are no sheets/tabs in CSV files.

### Source file columns for task defintions

The source file format is quite relaxed, but a few rules apply:

- The first column in the source file *must* be the task number.
  - This value uniquely identifies each task that should be imported and should be incremented by one for each task.
  - If this first column is empty the whole row will be ignored.
- All other columns, mandatory and optional, beyond the first one may be placed in any order.
  - For mandatory columns the names listed below *must* be used (but they can be placed in any order in the file, except the first column).
  - All mandatory columns must be present in the source file, even if they are not used/empty.
    For example, there may not be any tasks with schema/scheduled triggers, but the schema trigger columns must still be present in the source file.
- "Counter" columns are used to indicate that rows in the file are associated.
  - All rows involved in defining a certain task have the same "Task counter" value.
  - All rows involved in defining a certain schema or composite event have the same "Event counter" value.
  - All rows involved in defining a certain composite event rule have the same "Rule counter" value.
- The file format used when *exporting* task tables to disk is a superset of the format used for task *import*.
  It's thus a good idea to first do a task export, look at the file format and then adopt as needed before importing.

The *mandatory* columns in the task definition file are:

| Column name                  | Comment | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Valid values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Task counter                 | 1       | Counter starting at 1. Increments one step for each task. All rows associated with a specific task should have the same value in this column.                                                                                         | Integer > 0                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Task id                      | 1       | When creating new tasks a new task ID will always be created. This column is instead used to create task chains: it links a composite trigger in a downstream task with an upstream task via this column's value.                     | Any string, but to make it easier to verify task chains it's recommended to use integers or an easy to understand format in this column. <br>For example "3" or "new-task-3". <br> If no downstream task will link to the task being defined, this column can be left empty. |
| Task enabled                 | 1       | Should the created task be enabled or not.                                                                                                                                                                                            | 1 / 0 / blank. 1=enabled, 0 or blank=disabled                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

If the "Rule task id" refers to an existing task id in Sense, the new rule will link to that existing task. |

Meaning of "Comment" column above:

1: These columns are required for all lines where top-level task information is defined.  
2: These columns are required for all lines where general event info (shared for schema and composite events) is defined. There may be zero or more such lines for a specific task.  
3: These columns are required for all lines where schema events info are defined.  
4: These columns are required for all lines where composite events ("task chains") are defined.

### Source file columns for app import definitions

If apps should be imported (by means of the `--import-app` option) an Excel file must be provided with info about what app QVF files should be imported, as well as details about each app import.  
A sheet name (where the app details are found) in the Excel file must also be specified using the `--import-app-sheet-name` option.

The columns (case sensitive!) in the app import definition file are:

| Column name                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Valid values                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| Publish options <br>(optional) | Specify publish options here, for example if an already published app with the same name should be overwritten or not. <br>The default behaviour is `publish-replace`, which will be used when no "Publish options" column is present in the Excel sheet or that column exists but is empty. | `publish-replace`: If there already exists a published app with the same name in the specified stream, replace that app with the new one. <br> `publish-another`: If there already exists a published app with the same name in the specified stream, publish tnother one. <br>`delete-publish`: First delete an already existing app (if there is one), then publish the new app. |

The publish options are described in more detail [here](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/ctrl-q/discussions/234#discussioncomment-6173760).

### Example: Export tasks to CSV, then import tasks from same CSV

This example will

1. Export ca 50 tasks to a CSV file
2. Import tasks from the just created CSV file

The CSV file created during the task export will contain some columns that are not needed during task import (last execution timestamp for each task and similar).  
That's fine though, during the task import Ctrl-Q will only look at the required columns and simply disregard all other columns.

Export tasks to CSV file:

```powershell
.\ctrl-q.exe task-get `
--auth-type cert `
--host pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net `
--auth-user-dir LAB `
--auth-user-id goran `
--output-format table `
--output-dest file `
--output-file-name tasks.csv `
--output-file-format csv
```

```

Now let's import tasks from the `tasks.csv` file:

```powershell
.\ctrl-q.exe task-import `
--auth-type cert `
--host pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net `
--auth-cert-file ./cert/client.pem `
--auth-cert-key-file ./cert/client_key.pem `
--auth-user-dir LAB `
--auth-user-id goran `
--file-type csv `
--file-name tasks.csv
```

It's worth noting that all the created tasks will be linked into the task chains that existed when the tasks where first *exported* into the CSV file.  
This happens because the composite event rules that were exported into the CSV file (i.e. "start the task when task A and task B have successfully finished reloaded") contain task IDs that point to already existing reload tasks in Sense.  
When that's the case the newly created tasks (based on the info in the CSV file) will link to those existing tasks.

This way a newly created task (based on info in the CSV file) can still be configured to start after some already existing task finish reloading.

Note how Ctrl-Q first creates the reload tasks and any associated schedule triggers in a first step, then add any composite triggers in the second step.  
This is needed as a composite trigger may refer to an already existing and/or a newly created task (or multiple tasks of course), i.e. all tasks must first be created. Only then is it possible to create composite triggers.

### Example: Import apps from QVF files and create associated reload tasks

This example will

1. Import 3 apps from QVF files. Definitions of which files to import are stored in an Excel file.
   1. Tags and custom properties will be set for the apps.
   2. New app owners will be set.
   3. The apps will be published to streams.
2. Create reload tasks based on definitions in same Excel file (but on a different sheet).
3. The reload tasks will be associated with the previously imported apps.
4. The reload tasks will be linked in a task chain.
5. Some imported tasks will be triggered by already existing Sense tasks while others will be triggered by newly created tasks.
6. There will be a 2 second delay after each QVF file has finished uploading, to reduce load on the Sense server.

The task import command looks like this in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\ctrl-q.exe task-import `
--auth-type cert `
--host pro2-win1.lab.ptarmiganlabs.net `
--auth-cert-file ./cert/client.pem `
--auth-cert-key-file ./cert/client_key.pem `
--auth-user-dir LAB `
--auth-user-id goran `
--file-type excel `
--file-name tasks.xlsx `
--sheet-name "Ctrl-Q task import 1" `
--import-app `
--import-app-sheet-name "App import" `
--sleep-app-upload 2000
```

Some comments about the above command:

- The certificates used to authenticate with Sense are stored in the `cert` subdirectory, right under where Ctrl-Q is started from.  
  That's the default locataion, meaning that the options `--auth-cert-file` and `--auth-cert-key-file` are really not needed in this example.
- The app and task definitions are found in a Excel file (`--file-type` option) named `tasks.xlsx`.
- Task definitions are found in the Excel file's sheet named `Ctrl-Q task import`.
- The `--import-app` tells Ctrl-Q to import certain apps before tasks defined in the `Ctrl-Q task import 1` sheet are created. This parameter is optional. If it is **not** included no apps will be imported.
- The `--import-app-sheet-name` tells Ctrl-Q that a list of apps to be imported (and import parameters for each app) is found the `App import` sheet of the Excel file.

> NOTE 1: A sample defintions Excel file is [available in the GitHub repository](https://github.com/ptarmiganlabs/ctrl-q/blob/main/testdata/tasks.xlsx?raw=true).
> NOTE 2: The structure of the Excel sheet specified by the `--import-app-sheet-name` is described [above](#source-file-columns-for-app-import-definitions).

#### Defining tasks to be created

The format is the same as when importing tasks only (and no apps).  
More info [here](#source-file-columns-for-task-defintions).

#### Associating new tasks with imported and existing apps

A few special cases apply when tasks are created **and** apps also imported.

In this situation it's important that tasks can be associated with either the newly imported apps *or* already existing apps.  
Similarly, for composite task triggers (used to create task chains) it's important that either newly created tasks *or* already existing tasks can be referenced.

Let's say the following three QVF files should be imported into Sense.  
Note the `App counter` column, with values 1, 2 and 3.

![QVF app files that should be imported into Qlik Sense](/img/ctrl-q-app-import-1.png "QVF app files that should be imported into Qlik Sense")

Now let's look at the tasks to be created.
In the image below the main info (task name etc) for each of the four tasks is shown.  
Note that the `Task id` column has both proper GUIDs and simple integers in it.  
This will be important when defining composite triggers.

![Reload tasks should be created in Qlik Sense](/img/ctrl-q-task-import-1.png "Reload tasks should be created in Qlik Sense")

Finally let's look at the composite triggers associated with the last of the four tasks.  
That composite trigger relies on two tasks, one that should fail (`TaskFail`) to trigger the composite trigger and one that should succeed (`TaskSuccessful`).

The important part here is the last column, `Rule task id`:

- If that column contains a valid GUID it is assumed to be a reference to an *existing* task.
- If the column contains an integer it is assumed to be a reference to a *newly created* task. <br>
  Which task? The one with the same integer number in the `Task id` column (see previous paragraph).

This way it's possible to chain new reload tasks to both already existing tasks and new ones.

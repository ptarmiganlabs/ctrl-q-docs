Ctrl-Q is open source and you have access to all source code.

It is **_your responsibility_** to determine if Ctrl-Q is suitable for **your** use case.  
The creators of Ctrl-Q, including Ptarmigan Labs, GÃ¶ran Sander or any other contributor, can and must never be held liable to past or future security issues of Ctrl-Q.
If you have security concerns or ideas around Ctrl-Q, please get involved in the project and contribute to making it better!

    If you discover a serious bug with Ctrl-Q that may pose a security problem, please disclose it
    confidentially to security@ptarmiganlabs.com first, so it can be assessed and hopefully fixed
    prior to being exploited.

    Please do not raise GitHub issues for serious security-related doubts or problems.

## Virus scanning

Every time a Ctrl-Q release is done the created binaries are sent to [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/) for scanning.  
VirusTotal acts as an aggregated virus scanner that sends the Ctrl-Q binaries to dozens of anti-virus scanners, including many of the major/most widely used ones.

Links to the VirusTotal scan report are included in each release notes, making it easy to check the status of each binary:

A VirusTotal scan that reports "no risks found" can look like this:

### Positive scan vs false positives

If one or more of the security vendors used by VirusTotal reports an issue you have to make a decision.  
Is it a real issue or a false positive?

You have to decide this yourself, but some general lines of thought can be:

    Is it a single vendor that reports the Ctrl-Q binary file to be a risk, or several vendors?
    If one vendor reports an issue and 60+ vendors don't, you might be looking at a false positive.

But again - at the end of the day it's **you** that must make that decision.

A scan where a single security vendor reports an issue can look like this:

## Signed binaries

The macOS executable binary is signed and notarized by Apple's standard process.  
A warning may still be shown first time the app is started. This is expected and normal.

The Windows executable binary is signed by "Ptarmigan Labs AB".
